Week 1 (27.03.2023-02.04.2023)

Shakirova Natalia:

Create Profile page: https://github.com/sopra-fs23-group-39/sopra-client/issues/34 that consists of 2 tasks:

1. Display information from user database: https://github.com/sopra-fs23-group-39/sopra-client/issues/35: created a Profile component. When rendering this component, a useEffect hook is used to fetch data about a particular user (a GET request is sent to /users/{userId}). In the backend, a corresponding GET endpoint (in UserController) and a method getUserProfile (in UserService) are added.

2. Add "Change Credentials" and "Back" buttons: https://github.com/sopra-fs23-group-39/sopra-client/issues/36: created buttons, button Back redirects to /main, button ChangeCredentials - to /changes/{userId} (a corresponding function is invoked when each of the buttons is clicked). 

Commit for the client part (both tasks): 0a8131d

Commit for the server part: 547022f
